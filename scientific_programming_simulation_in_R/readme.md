- debugging your own functions
- object-oriented programming
- interface for C


###Ch9: Numerical accuracy and program efficiency
- how computers operate within R
- the time it takes to perform a computation
- speed up
- memory limitations on computation efficiency

###Ch10: Root-finding
- different techniques for find- ing roots
- fixed-point iteration
- Newton-Raphson method
