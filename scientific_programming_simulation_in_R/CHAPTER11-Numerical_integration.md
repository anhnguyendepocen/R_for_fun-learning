CHAPTER 11 Numerical integration
=====


for many functions f it is impossible to write down an antiderivative in closed form -> use numerical integration to approximate the definite integral.

#Topic
- the trape- zoid rule
- Simpsonâ€™s rule
- adaptive quadrature

#11.1 Trapezoidal rule- approximating the area under y = f(x) over the subinterval [xi,xi+1] by a trapezoid
